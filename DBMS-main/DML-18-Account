Question 18: SQL DML Operations
1. Create Tables
sql
Copy
-- Account Table
CREATE TABLE Account (
    Acc_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    balance DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (branch_name) REFERENCES branch(branch_name)
);

-- Branch Table
CREATE TABLE branch (
    branch_name VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_city VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    assets DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL
);

-- Customer Table
CREATE TABLE customer (
    cust_name VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    cust_street VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    cust_city VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

-- Depositor Table
CREATE TABLE Depositor (
    cust_name VARCHAR(50),
    Acc_no INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (cust_name, Acc_no),
    FOREIGN KEY (cust_name) REFERENCES customer(cust_name),
    FOREIGN KEY (Acc_no) REFERENCES Account(Acc_no)
);

-- Loan Table
CREATE TABLE Loan (
    loan_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (branch_name) REFERENCES branch(branch_name)
);

-- Borrower Table
CREATE TABLE Borrower (
    cust_name VARCHAR(50),
    loan_no INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (cust_name, loan_no),
    FOREIGN KEY (cust_name) REFERENCES customer(cust_name),
    FOREIGN KEY (loan_no) REFERENCES Loan(loan_no)
);
2. Solve Queries
sql
Copy
-- Query 1: Find names of all branches in loan relation
SELECT DISTINCT branch_name FROM Loan;

-- Query 2: Find loan numbers for loans made at Akurdi Branch with amount > 12000
SELECT loan_no FROM Loan
WHERE branch_name = 'Akurdi' AND amount > 12000;

-- Query 3: Find all customers who have a loan from the bank
SELECT DISTINCT cust_name FROM Borrower;

-- Query 4: Find customer names, loan numbers, and loan amounts
SELECT c.cust_name, b.loan_no, l.amount
FROM customer c
JOIN Borrower b ON c.cust_name = b.cust_name
JOIN Loan l ON b.loan_no = l.loan_no;

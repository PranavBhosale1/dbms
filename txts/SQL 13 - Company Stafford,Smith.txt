DDL 13 - ER Company.txt
=========================

Question:
---------
Create the instance of the COMPANY which consists of the following tables:
EMPLOYEE(Fname, Minit, Lname, Ssn, Bdate, Address, Sex, Salary, Dno)  
DEPARTMENT(Dname, Dno, Mgr_ssn, Mgr_start_date)  
DEPT_LOCATIONS(Dnumber, Dlocation)  
PROJECT(Pname, Pnumber, Plocation, Dno)  
WORKS_ON(Essn, Pno, Hours)  
DEPENDENT(Essn, Dependent_name, Sex, Bdate, Relationship)

Queries to Perform:
--------------------
1. For every project located in ‘Stafford’, list the project number, the controlling department number,
   and the department manager’s last name, address, and birth date.
2. Make a list of all project numbers for projects that involve an employee whose last name is ‘Smith’,
   either as a worker or as a manager of the department that controls the project.
3. Retrieve all employees whose address is in Houston, Texas.
4. Show the resulting salaries if every employee working on the ‘ProductX’ project is given a 10 percent raise.

Below is the solution for the SQL task based on the provided task from "DDL 13 - ER Company.txt". It includes the creation of the database and tables (EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT, DEPT_LOCATIONS, PROJECT, WORKS_ON, DEPENDENT) with appropriate primary, foreign key, and other constraints, insertion of sample data, and execution of the specified queries to retrieve company-related information. The solution uses proper SQL syntax, provides a detailed explanation of the syntax used, and explains the logic behind each operation. The code is wrapped in an artifact tag as per the guidelines, with the content type set to text/sql for SQL.

The task requires:

Creating a database CompanyDB13 and six tables with constraints:
EMPLOYEE (Fname, Minit, Lname, Ssn, Bdate, Address, Sex, Salary, Dno)
DEPARTMENT (Dname, Dno, Mgr_ssn, Mgr_start_date)
DEPT_LOCATIONS (Dnumber, Dlocation)
PROJECT (Pname, Pnumber, Plocation, Dno)
WORKS_ON (Essn, Pno, Hours)
DEPENDENT (Essn, Dependent_name, Sex, Bdate, Relationship)
Inserting sample data into all tables, ensuring foreign key constraints are respected (e.g., inserting managers before departments).
Executing four queries:
List project number, controlling department number, and department manager’s last name, address, and birth date for projects in Stafford.
List project numbers for projects involving an employee named Smith (as a worker or department manager).
Retrieve all employees whose address is in Houston, Texas.
Show the resulting salaries if employees working on the ProductX project receive a 10% raise.

Syntax Used
Database Creation and Selection:
Syntax: CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS <database_name>; USE <database_name>;
Example:
sql

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS CompanyDB13;
USE CompanyDB13;
Purpose: Creates the CompanyDB13 database if it doesn’t exist and switches to it.
Table Creation with Constraints:
Syntax: CREATE TABLE <table_name> ( <column1> <type> [constraints], ... , [FOREIGN KEY (<column>) REFERENCES <table>(<column>)] );
Example:
sql

CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENT (
    Dname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Dno INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Mgr_ssn CHAR(9),
    Mgr_start_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (Mgr_ssn) REFERENCES EMPLOYEE(Ssn)
);
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE (
    Fname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Minit CHAR(1),
    Lname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Ssn CHAR(9) PRIMARY KEY,
    Bdate DATE,
    Address VARCHAR(100),
    Sex CHAR(1),
    Salary DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (Salary >= 0),
    Dno INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Dno) REFERENCES DEPARTMENT(Dno)
);
Purpose: Creates tables with:
Primary keys (Dno, Ssn, Pnumber, composite keys for DEPT_LOCATIONS, WORKS_ON, DEPENDENT) for uniqueness.
Foreign keys linking tables (e.g., EMPLOYEE.Dno to DEPARTMENT.Dno, WORKS_ON.Essn to EMPLOYEE.Ssn) for referential integrity.
CHECK constraints (e.g., Salary >= 0, Hours >= 0) to enforce data validity.
NOT NULL for required fields and DECIMAL(10,2) for precise monetary amounts.
Insert Data:
Syntax: INSERT INTO <table_name> [(columns)] VALUES ( <value1>, <value2>, ... ), ...;
Example:
sql

INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE (Fname, Minit, Lname, Ssn, Bdate, Address, Sex, Salary, Dno) VALUES
('Pranav', 'A', 'Bhosale', '111223333', '1999-01-15', 'Pune, India', 'M', 90000.00, NULL),
...
Purpose: Populates tables with sample data, ensuring foreign key constraints are respected by inserting managers first and updating their department numbers after DEPARTMENT creation.
Update Data:
Syntax: UPDATE <table> SET <column> = <value> WHERE <condition>;
Example:
sql

UPDATE EMPLOYEE SET Dno = 1 WHERE Ssn = '111223333';
Purpose: Assigns department numbers to managers after departments are created.
Queries:
Query 1: Projects in Stafford with Manager Details:
Syntax: SELECT <columns> FROM <table1> JOIN <table2> ON <condition> JOIN <table3> ON <condition> WHERE <condition>;
Example:
sql

SELECT p.Pnumber, p.Dno, e.Lname, e.Address, e.Bdate
FROM PROJECT p
JOIN DEPARTMENT d ON p.Dno = d.Dno
JOIN EMPLOYEE e ON d.Mgr_ssn = e.Ssn
WHERE p.Plocation = 'Stafford';
Purpose: Retrieves project and manager details for Stafford projects.
Query 2: Projects Involving Smith (Worker or Manager):
Syntax: SELECT DISTINCT <column> FROM <table1> LEFT JOIN <table2> ON <condition> ... WHERE <condition> OR <condition>;
Example:
sql

SELECT DISTINCT p.Pnumber
FROM PROJECT p
LEFT JOIN WORKS_ON w ON p.Pnumber = w.Pno
LEFT JOIN EMPLOYEE e1 ON w.Essn = e1.Ssn
LEFT JOIN DEPARTMENT d ON p.Dno = d.Dno
LEFT JOIN EMPLOYEE e2 ON d.Mgr_ssn = e2.Ssn
WHERE e1.Lname = 'Smith' OR e2.Lname = 'Smith';
Purpose: Finds projects where Smith is a worker or department manager.
Query 3: Employees in Houston, Texas:
Syntax: SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE <column> LIKE <pattern>;
Example:
sql

SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE Address LIKE '%Houston, Texas%';
Purpose: Retrieves all employee details for those in Houston, Texas.
Query 4: 10% Salary Raise for ProductX Workers:
Syntax: SELECT <columns>, <column> * <factor> AS <alias> FROM <table1> JOIN <table2> ON <condition> JOIN <table3> ON <condition> WHERE <condition>;
Example:
sql

SELECT e.Fname, e.Lname, e.Salary, e.Salary * 1.10 AS RaisedSalary
FROM EMPLOYEE e
JOIN WORKS_ON w ON e.Ssn = w.Essn
JOIN PROJECT p ON w.Pno = p.Pnumber
WHERE p.Pname = 'ProductX';
Purpose: Calculates new salaries with a 10% raise for ProductX workers.
Explanation of Logic
Database and Table Setup:
The CompanyDB13 database is created.
Tables are defined with primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to ensure data integrity.
EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT have a circular foreign key relationship (DEPARTMENT.Mgr_ssn references EMPLOYEE.Ssn, EMPLOYEE.Dno references DEPARTMENT.Dno), so managers are inserted with Dno as NULL, departments are created, and then EMPLOYEE.Dno is updated.
Sample Data:
EMPLOYEE: Six employees, including two managers (Pranav, Jay) and one named Smith.
DEPARTMENT: Two departments (Research, Development).
DEPT_LOCATIONS: Locations for departments (Houston, Stafford, Mumbai).
PROJECT: Four projects, two in Stafford (ProductX, InfraDev).
WORKS_ON: Links employees to projects with hours worked.
DEPENDENT: Five dependents linked to employees.
Queries:
Query 1: Joins PROJECT, DEPARTMENT, and EMPLOYEE to find Stafford projects (101: ProductX, Dno 1, Pranav Bhosale; 104: InfraDev, Dno 2, Jay Rajankar). Results:
Pnumber: 101, Dno: 1, Lname: Bhosale, Address: Pune, India, Bdate: 1999-01-15
Pnumber: 104, Dno: 2, Lname: Rajankar, Address: Mumbai, India, Bdate: 1998-05-10
Query 2: Uses left joins to find projects where Smith is a worker (104: InfraDev) or manager (none, as Smith is not a manager). Result: Pnumber 104.
Query 3: Filters employees with addresses containing “Houston, Texas” (Anvay Kulkarni, Krishna Gandhi).
Query 4: Joins EMPLOYEE, WORKS_ON, and PROJECT to find ProductX workers (Pranav: ₹90000 → ₹99000, Anvay: ₹72000 → ₹79200).
Efficiency: Primary and foreign keys ensure efficient joins. Queries use targeted joins and filters, optimized for the small dataset. DISTINCT in Query 2 prevents duplicate project numbers.
Why This Solution Satisfies the Problem
Correct Syntax: Uses standard SQL syntax for database creation, table setup with constraints, data insertion, updates, and query execution.
Schema Adherence: Tables (EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT, DEPT_LOCATIONS, PROJECT, WORKS_ON, DEPENDENT) match the specified schema with primary, foreign key, and check constraints.
Query Accuracy:
Query 1 correctly retrieves Stafford project and manager details.
Query 2 identifies projects involving Smith as a worker or manager.
Query 3 lists Houston, Texas employees.
Query 4 calculates 10% salary raises for ProductX workers.
Theory Alignment: Demonstrates DDL (table creation), DML (INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT), joins, pattern matching (LIKE), and arithmetic operations in a company database context.
Complete Implementation: Includes all steps—database creation, table setup, data insertion, updates, and query execution.
Enhanced Output: Retains the original logic and data, ensuring accurate and clear results with proper handling of circular dependencies.
